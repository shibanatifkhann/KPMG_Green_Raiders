## Our Solution

With just scanning the product's barcode, you'll be able to see a carbon rating (out of 100) and list of alternative product with better carbon rating. Moreover, you'll be awarded Green Coins (blockchain based coin) based on your purchase decision, which is an financial product reaping it's benefit when we perform an ICO (Initial Coin Offering).

Hence, contributing towards the evolution of the way business is done through

Through our database development on the processes businesses are utilizing we would be helping them three fold towards reaching carbon neutrality :

1. Access to ESG Target Customer: Our platform provides direct access to ESG concious market which is further expected to grow at a CAGR 14% per year in Korea. It becomes valuable as we gain trust from the consumer.

2. Korean Carbon Offset: We provide services of Carbon Offset to companies, where they will be entitled to grow and not to just buy existing greenfields, hence making a real impact to firm's stakeholders.

3. Consultancy Services: With the help of our AI backed database, we would be helping firm with optimizing their processes towards the path of carbon neutrality.

## Data Development Process

Our idea is based upon our Data Management Strategy that helps us to deliver effective and yet cost & energy effective solution, we are utilizing the essence of segregation of step-wise database build-up with infused feedback-loop and AI techniques to deliver our value proposition.

The iGreenify application implements various AI techniques and approaches to provide exclusive service and user experience.
The application is mainly build on Flutter using Dart programming language, which is famous for its resemblence to other popular object oriented languages such as JavaScript. 

As a backend, we're utilizing the great potential of Firebase - a platform that proves its efficiency when used in Flutter applications. User Authentication and Database handling are possible with respective packages from Firebase.

We implement computer vision through barcode scanner and image recognition. Barcode scanning is imported as an external Flutter package. Our custom-made product barcode databse closely resembles commercial databases.

As a part of our AI solution, we are using NLP and supervised learning to classify typical business processes into 3 disctinct categories.

Trained on a custom-made dataset, MonkeyLearn API learns patterns and categorizes processes based on keywords typical to the process category.

Example: trained on a set containing words "transportation", "shipment", and "delivery", MonkeyLearn API will successfully predict countless number of processes descriptions including these words to be a part of "Shipping and transportation" category.
