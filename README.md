# Our Solution

With just scanning the product's barcode, you'll be able to see a carbon rating (out of 100) and list of alternative product with better carbon rating. Moreover, you'll be awarded Green Coins (blockchain based coin) based on your purchase decision, which is an financial product reaping it's benefit when we perform an ICO (Initial Coin Offering).

Hence, contributing towards the evolution of the way business is done through

Through our database development on the processes businesses are utilizing we would be helping them three fold towards reaching carbon neutrality :

1. Access to ESG Target Customer: Our platform provides direct access to ESG concious market which is further expected to grow at a CAGR 14% per year in Korea. It becomes valuable as we gain trust from the consumer.

2. Korean Carbon Offset: We provide services of Carbon Offset to companies, where they will be entitled to grow and not to just buy existing greenfields, hence making a real impact to firm's stakeholders.

3. Consultancy Services: With the help of our AI backed database, we would be helping firm with optimizing their processes towards the path of carbon neutrality.

# Product - Usage

## Sign Up
iGreenify mobile application makes use of Firebase as a backend for user authentication. After proceeding smoothly with the registration process, user is then directed to the main application screen.
## Sign In
All registered information is stored in the Firebase database that communicates to the Flutter mobile application in real time. The authentication flow guarantees safe information storage, fast responses, and password recovery.
## Scan Barcode
As soon as the user is identified, they are directed to the main page of the application. At the central page, the user is prompted to scan the barcode of a product they are about to purchase. The page contains only one button responsible for bringing up the fast and easy-to-use barcode scanner.
## Check Alternative Product List
As soon as the barcode is scanned, the barcode number retrieved is checked for existence in the main application database. If such number exists, the calculated carbon rating is displayed next to the product's name. The user can then see the names of similar products from the same category and their respective calculated carbon ratings. Based on them, the user can opt for "greener" options, which would result in the public's support of carbon-aware manufacturing businesses.

# Data Development Process

Our idea is based upon our Data Management Strategy that helps us to deliver effective and yet cost & energy effective solution, we are utilizing the essence of segregation of step-wise database build-up with infused feedback-loop and AI techniques to deliver our value proposition.

The iGreenify application implements various AI techniques and approaches to provide exclusive service and user experience.
The application is mainly build on Flutter using Dart programming language, which is famous for its resemblence to other popular object oriented languages such as JavaScript. 

As a backend, we're utilizing the great potential of Firebase - a platform that proves its efficiency when used in Flutter applications. User Authentication and Database handling are possible with respective packages from Firebase.

We implement computer vision through barcode scanner and image recognition. Barcode scanning is imported as an external Flutter package. Our custom-made product barcode databse closely resembles commercial databases.

As a part of our AI solution, we are using NLP and supervised learning to classify typical business processes into 3 disctinct categories.

Trained on a custom-made dataset, MonkeyLearn API learns patterns and categorizes processes based on keywords typical to the process category.

Example: trained on a set containing words "transportation", "shipment", and "delivery", MonkeyLearn API will successfully predict countless number of processes descriptions including these words to be a part of "Shipping and transportation" category.
