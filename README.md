## Solution

With just scanning the product's barcode, you'll be able to see a carbon rating (out of 100) and list of alternative product with better carbon rating. Moreover, you'll be awarded Green Coins (blockchain based coin) based on your purchase decision, which is an investment reaping it's benefit when we do an ICO (Initial Coin Offering).

## Data Development Process


As a part of our AI solution, we are using NLP and supervised learning to classify typical business processes into 3 disctinct categories.

Trained on a custom-made dataset, MonkeyLearn API learns patterns and categorizes processes based on keywords typical to the process category.

Example: trained on a set containing words "transportation", "shipment", and "delivery", MonkeyLearn API will successfully predict countless number of processes descriptions including these words to be a part of "Shipping and transportation" category.
